            James Banewicz is a student working towards becoming a graphic
            designer and who will be graduating with his graphic and web design
            diploma in September of 2022. From there, he hopes to become a
            freelance graphic artist for logos and other related projects.

            In his younger years, James participated in art courses as an
            elective in high school and learned patience and attention to detail.
             James always had a passion for arts because it was a way to express
            himself or to help others express what they couldn't on their own.
            One day, he hopes to become a successful designer and open a design
            studio because he believes it would be a very interesting and inspiring
            career to pursue.
